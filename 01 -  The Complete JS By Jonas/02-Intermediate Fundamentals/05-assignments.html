        /* LECTURE 1: Functions
        1. Write a function called 'describeCountry' which takes three parameters:
        'country', 'population' and 'capitalCity'. Based on this input, the
        function returns a string with this format: 'Finland has 6 million people and its
        capital city is Helsinki'
        2. Call this function 3 times, with input data for 3 different countries. Store the
        returned values in 3 different variables, and log them to the console */

            return `${country} has ${population} million people and its capital city is ${capitalCity}`;
        }

        const descIndia = describeCountry('India', 1406, 'Delhi');
        const descPakistan = describeCountry('Pakistan', 240, 'Islamabad');
        const descSrilanka = describeCountry('Sri Lanka', 218, ' Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte');

        console.log(`${descIndia} ||| ${descPakistan} ||| ${descSrilanka}`);


        /* LECTURE 2: Function Declarations vs. Expressions
        1. The world population is 7900 million people. Create a function declaration
        called 'percentageOfWorld1' which receives a 'population' value, and
        returns the percentage of the world population that the given population
        represents. For example, China has 1441 million people, so it's about 18.2% of
        the world population
        2. To calculate the percentage, divide the given 'population' value by 7900
        and then multiply by 100
        3. Call 'percentageOfWorld1' for 3 populations of countries of your choice,
        store the results into variables, and log them to the console
        4. Create a function expression which does the exact same thing, called
        'percentageOfWorld2', and also call it with 3 country populations (can be
        the same populations) */

        // Function Declaration
        function percentageOfWorld1(population) {
            return (population / 7900) * 100;
        }

        // Function Expression
        const percentageOfWorld2 = function (population) {
            return (population / 7900) * 100;
        }

        const percIndia = percentageOfWorld1(1406)
        const percPakistan = percentageOfWorld1(240)

        /* LECTURE 3 : Arrow Functions
        1. Recreate the last assignment, but this time create an arrow function called
        'percentageOfWorld3' */

        const percentageOfWorld3 = (population) => {
            return (population / 7900) * 100;

        /* LECTURE 4: Functions Calling Other Functions
        1. Create a function called 'describePopulation'. Use the function type you
        like the most. This function takes in two arguments: 'country' and
        'population', and returns a string like this: 'China has 1441 million people,
        which is about 18.2% of the world.'
        2. To calculate the percentage, 'describePopulation' call the
        'percentageOfWorld1' you created earlier
        3. Call 'describePopulation' with data for 3 countries of your choice */

        describePopulation('India', 1406)
        describePopulation('Pakistan', 240)

        /* LECTURE 5: Introduction to Arrays
        1. Create an array containing 4 population values of 4 countries of your choice.
        You may use the values you have been using previously. Store this array into a
        variable called 'populations'
        2. Log to the console whether the array has 4 elements or not (true or false)
        3. Create an array called 'percentages' containing the percentages of the
        world population for these 4 population values. Use the function
        'percentageOfWorld1' that you created earlier to compute the 4
        percentage values */

        const populations = [1441, 1406, 240, 218]
        console.log(populations.length === 4)

            percentageOfWorld1(populations[2]),
            percentageOfWorld1(populations[3])]
        console.log(percentages)


        /* LECTURE 6: Basic Array Operations (Methods)
        1. Create an array containing all the neighbouring countries of a country of your
        choice. Choose a country which has at least 2 or 3 neighbours. Store the array
        into a variable called 'neighbours'
        2. At some point, a new country called 'Utopia' is created in the neighbourhood of
        your selected country. So add it to the end of the 'neighbours' array
        3. Unfortunately, after some time, the new country is dissolved. So remove it from
        the end of the array
        4. If the 'neighbours' array does not include the country ‘Germany’, log to the
        console: 'Probably not a central European country :D'
        5. Change the name of one of your neighbouring countries. To do that, find the
        index of the country in the 'neighbours' array, and then use that index to
        change the array at that index position. For example, you can search for
        'Sweden' in the array, and then replace it with 'Republic of Sweden'. */

        const neighbours = ['Pakistan', 'Sri Lanka', 'Afghanistan']
        console.log(neighbours)

        neighbours.push('Utopia')

        }

        neighbours[neighbours.indexOf('Pakistan')] = 'Pakistaaaan'
        console.log(neighbours)



        /* LECTURE 7: Introduction to Objects
        1. Create an object called 'myCountry' for a country of your choice, containing
        properties 'country', 'capital', 'language', 'population' and
        'neighbours' (an array like we used in previous assignments) */

        const myCountry = {
            country: 'India',
            capital: 'Delhi',
            language: 'Hindi',
            population: 148,
            neighbours: ['Pakistan', 'SriLanka', 'Nepal'],
        }
        console.log(myCountry)

        /* LECTURE 8: Dot vs. Bracket Notation
        1. Using the object from the previous assignment, log a string like this to the
        console: 'Finland has 6 million finnish-speaking people, 3 neighbouring countries
        and a capital called Helsinki.'
        2. Increase the country's population by two million using dot notation, and then
        decrease it by two million using brackets notation. */

        /* LECTURE 9: Object Methods
        1. Add a method called 'describe' to the 'myCountry' object. This method
        will log a string to the console, similar to the string logged in the previous
        assignment, but this time using the 'this' keyword.
        2. Call the 'describe' method */

        };
        console.log(myCountry.describe())

        /* 3. Add a method called 'checkIsland' to the 'myCountry' object. This
        method will set a new property on the object, called 'isIsland'.
        'isIsland' will be true if there are no neighbouring countries, and false if
        there are. Use the ternary operator to set the property. */

            return `${this.neighbours ? false : true}`
        }

        // For Loop

        /* LECTURE 10: Iteration: The for Loop
        1. There are elections in your country! In a small town, there are only 50 voters.
        Use a for loop to simulate the 50 people voting, by logging a string like this to
        the console (for numbers 1 to 50): 'Voter number 1 is currently voting' */

        /* LECTURE 11: Looping Arrays, Breaking and Continuing
        1. Let's bring back the 'populations' array from a previous assignment
        2. Use a for loop to compute an array called 'percentages2' containing the
        percentages of the world population for the 4 population values. Use the
        function 'percentageOfWorld1' that you created earlier
        3. Confirm that 'percentages2' contains exactly the same values as the
        'percentages' array that we created manually in the previous assignment,
        and reflect on how much better this solution is */

        1. Store this array of arrays into a variable called 'listOfNeighbours'
        [['Canada', 'Mexico'], ['Spain'], ['Norway', 'Sweden',
        'Russia']];
        2. Log only the neighbouring countries to the console, one by one, not the entire
        arrays. Log a string like 'Neighbour: Canada' for each country
        3. You will need a loop inside a loop for this. This is actually a bit tricky, so don't
        worry if it's too difficult for you! But you can still try to figure this out anyway � */
